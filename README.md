Bayou
=====

A framework to ensure eventual consistency among distributed systems.

Client Application used here is a Playlist of songs. 

Features
--------

The features of Bayou implemented in this protocol are:

1.  Reach eventual consistency while minimizing assumptions about communication characteristics.
> Design: Peer-to-peer anti-entropy for propagation of updates.

2.  System support for detection of update conflicts.
> Design: Dependency checks on each write.

3.  Commit data to a stable value as soon as possible.
> Design: Include a primary whose purpose is to commit data and set the order in which data is committed

4.  Permit disconnected clients and groups to see their own updates.
> Design: Clients can read tentative data with an expectation that it will be committed with the same effect if possible.

5.  Provide a client with a view of the replicated data that is consistent with its own actions.
> Design: Session guarantees. [Implemented - Read your writes]
